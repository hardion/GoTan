Welcome to the Tango module for Gotan.

The purpose is to access the Tango world through the Gotan REST server

1. RUN IMMEDIATELY
------------------

This project comes with a build system so you can compile and run without install anything.

    $ export TANGO_HOST=127.0.0.1:10000
    $ ./gradlew assemble
    $ ./gradlew run

You could also want to change some parameters :

    $ ./gradlew run -Pgotan="-c /gtn -p 9999 --device-pattern sys/*/*"

For the complete list of parameters :

    $ ./gradlew run -Pgotan="-h"


2. COMPILE
----------

To compile without test :

    $ ./gradlew assemble

To really build the project with the test :

    $ ./gradlew build

You can also use your local gradle installation :

    $ gradle build



2.1. INTEGRATION TEST
------------------

Some integration were written to control the development.

Prerequisites :
- environment variable TANGO_HOST correctly set
- TangoTest DeviceServer running a sys/tg_test/1

    $ ./gradlew test


3. Make the Distribution
------------------------

To make a portable distribution with libraries and scripts :

    $ ./gradlew distTar
    or
    $ ./gradlew distZip


4. RUN SURELY
-------------

unzip gotan-tango-1.0-XXX.zip
or
tar -xvzf gotan-tango-1.0-XXX.tar.gz

    $ gotan-tango-1.0-XXX/bin/gotan-tango -h

You can go deeper by running the application with your installation of groovy
